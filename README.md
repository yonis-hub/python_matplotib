## Instructions

Your tasks are to do the following:

* Before beginning the analysis, check the data for any mouse ID with duplicate time points and remove any data associated with that mouse ID.

* Use the cleaned data for the remaining steps.

* Generate a summary statistics table consisting of the mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.

* Generate a bar plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen throughout the course of the study.

  * **NOTE:** These plots should look identical.

* Generate a pie plot using both Pandas's `DataFrame.plot()` and Matplotlib's `pyplot` that shows the distribution of female or male mice in the study.

  * **NOTE:** These plots should look identical.

* Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin. Calculate the quartiles and IQR and quantitatively determine if there are any potential outliers across all four treatment regimens.

* Using Matplotlib, generate a box and whisker plot of the final tumor volume for all four treatment regimens and highlight any potential outliers in the plot by changing their color and style.
